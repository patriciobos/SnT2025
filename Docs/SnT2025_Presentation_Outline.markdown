### 1. Introduction (1.5 minutes)  
- **Greeting and Context** (0.5 min):  
  - Welcome the audience and briefly introduce yourself (name, affiliation, expertise).  
  - Mention the conference theme and the relevance of coastal acoustic monitoring.  
  - Example: “Good [morning/afternoon], I’m [Your Name] from [Your Institution]. Today, I’m excited to share our work on a portable buoy designed to enhance acoustic monitoring on the Argentinian continental shelf, addressing challenges in shallow-water environments.”  
- **Problem Statement** (1 min):  
  - Highlight challenges of monitoring underwater acoustic events in shallow waters like the Argentinian continental shelf.  
  - Mention high transmission losses (TL) at low frequencies and limited IMS coverage in coastal zones due to three-dimensional propagation effects near the shelf edge.  
  - State the goal: Present a portable buoy as a potential complement to the IMS hydroacoustic network.

### 2. The Portable Acoustic Monitoring Buoy (3.5 minutes)  
- **Design and Purpose** (2 min):  
  - Describe the buoy as a cost-effective, portable passive acoustic monitoring system.  
  - Explain its design for deployment on the Argentinian continental shelf, addressing shallow-water challenges.  
  - Highlight its significance as a prototype for advancing scientific research in coastal zones.  
  - Example: “Our buoy is a lightweight, deployable system that records local acoustic data, overcoming the limitations of global IMS stations in shallow waters.”  
- **Technical Features** (1.5 min):  
  - Briefly outline the buoy’s key features (e.g., sensors, data collection capabilities, portability).  
  - Mention its ability to provide localized measurements to complement IMS hydrophone data.  
  - Note its cost-effectiveness and potential for scalable deployment.

### 3. Simulations and Applications (4 minutes)  
- **Simulations** (2 min):  
  - Discuss simulations conducted to evaluate the buoy’s performance.  
  - Explain how simulations confirm the need for localized monitoring to address TL challenges at low frequencies.  
  - Present results showing how the buoy’s data can complement IMS hydrophone stations for omnidirectional acoustic source events.  
  - Example: “Our simulations of acoustic events, such as those near the continental slope, demonstrate that the buoy captures signals that IMS stations may miss due to propagation effects.”  
- **Applications** (2 min):  
  - Highlight real-world applications, such as analyzing the ARA San Juan submarine loss (2017).  
  - Discuss broader uses, including studying oceanic properties and enhancing maritime monitoring near the continental shelf.  
  - Emphasize how combining buoy data with IMS data improves understanding of coastal acoustic environments.
